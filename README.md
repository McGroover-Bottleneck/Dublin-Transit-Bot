# Node-Express-TS-Template

Finally, a template for a TS project with barely any copy paste!
I created this Template so that I can get up and running with a node project that already has the eslint/prettier/tslint auto-formatting stuff setup right from the start rather then having to copy/paste config files from other projects.

## Setup

1. `yarn install`
2. Add your own .env file so that `process.env.PORT` works
3. `yarn start`
4. Boom

### TODO

-   Configure tsconfig.json to use the latest and greatest JS + TS features
-   Add some node auto-reload stuff
